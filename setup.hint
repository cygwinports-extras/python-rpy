ldesc: "RPy is a very simple, yet robust, Python interface to the R 
Programming Language. It can manage all kinds of R objects and can 
execute arbitrary R functions (including the graphic functions). All 
errors from the R language are converted to Python exceptions. Any 
module installed for the R system can be used from within Python."
